# Recommender SystemüéÅ

In this project, I developed a Movie Recommender System using Natural Language Processing techniques. The system utilizes data loading, preprocessing, and a recommendation function based on a Cosine similarity matrix. It includes a user-friendly interface with a select box to choose a movie, and it displays recommended movies along with their posters.
